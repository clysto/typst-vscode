# Typst Basic VS Code Extension

A basic VS Code extension for Typst.

> I prefer simple things and don’t need PDF preview or UI features, so this extension only borrows Tinymist’s LSP functionality. If you need more features, you can use Tinymist’s VS Code extension.

## Features

All features are provided by [Tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist).
